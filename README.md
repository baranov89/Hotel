# Hotel
Hotel is a test application that allows you to view information about the hotel and its rooms, as well as register guests. Despite its limited functionality, the app provides useful information about the rooms, their cost, and availability.

You can view photos of the rooms and descriptions of their features. You can also find out about the services provided by the hotel, such as a pool, restaurant, gym, etc.

Using Hotel, you can register hotel guests by entering their details, check-in and check-out dates, and selecting a suitable room. This is convenient for hotel managers who can quickly register new guests and manage bookings.

Although the app's functionality is limited, it can be useful for those looking for information about hotel rooms or wanting to quickly register guests.
